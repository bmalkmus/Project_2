# Bootleg Cooking

## Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our app, Bootleg Cooking, is designed to help our users find a new recipe to try for a meal using ingredients the user already has in their household. <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This app allows our users to input ingredients that they already have in their household. The user then can select which ingredients they want to include in their search. Once ingredients selected and the search button is clicked, three recipes will be shown to the user to select. Immediately the user is shown the picture of the finished product, ingredients used/missing, and a link to find out more information on the recipe. The user can click through the links to see the full details on the recipe. <br><br>
